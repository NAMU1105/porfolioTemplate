  "introductionLong": "Even after achieving my teenage dream job, working for the United Nations, I was not satisfied. I realised that achieving a goal / dream is important but the process and focusing on the present is the most precious and beautiful. That is how I started mindfulness through Aura-Soma, Kundalini Yoga and Akasha Sacred. These modalities supported my soul, spirit and body alignment. Now, I am here to serve you to find your inner & outer beauty within. On top of that, I also experienced that our body is aligned with mind and soul. So, I am able to recommend ways to nourish your body with supplements if you need. (Especially, I experimented with my body for weight loss and it worked. I can share everything that I know in terms of nutrition, healthy tips and weight management.)",
